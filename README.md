# Sample-Game
This game is a number-guessing game. The player must guess a random number between 1 and 100. Each time the player guesses, the number of guesses increases. If the player guesses the number correctly, the game ends.

The game is very simple, but it can be expanded to add more features. For example, you can add a time limit to the game. A scoring system can also be added to the game.

Here are some tips for developing simple games with TypeScript:

Use an appropriate data structure to store game data. In the example above, arrays are used.
Use appropriate methods to manage game information. In the example above, the start(), guess(), and end() methods are used.
Use helper functions to perform repetitive tasks. For example, a helper function can be used to generate a random number.
Use the tests to make sure the game is working properly.
I hope this example is useful for you..ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž
